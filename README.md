# Tic-Tac-Toe_v2.0


## Description 

This is a different version of Jeu_Du_Morpion_v1.0. The goal is still to build a simple tic-tac-toe using a Bootstrap however the table is replaced by simple col and row with full responsiveness. 
Here are the other criterias required for this story:    
 - Each player alternates.    
 - Selecting a cell already filled with a cross or a nought is not permitted.  
 - When 3 crosses or 3 noughts are aligned, the cells background turns in green.  
 - When someone wins, the next click restarts the game.
